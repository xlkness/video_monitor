My graduation design... it is very funny and simple, hha...

It is a simple video stream monitor using UVC(usb video class),
V4L2(video for linux), tcp, jpg and AVI format container.
You can use a logitech camera(mine is c270),
a embedded SoC board(mine is FriendlyARM called tiny6410
with an usb1.0 port and a network port) and a Windows(or a Linux)
operation system client which is installed java runtime environment to run the client.

It's framework is shown in the picture:

The server is running in the embedded board:

image::server1.jpg[]
image::server2.jpg[]

Now, the monitor's real-time friendly interface is:

connection pane:

video pane:

image::client.jpg[]

As you can see, it provides taking photo, recording and exitint button which
generate a jpg picture or a AVI format video stream saving in the SD card.

Not bad, hha, but it's very easy. I directly use tcp to send a real-time video frames
 which captured from the camera using UVC driver to the java client, no streaming media protocol.
 And the jave client use two OS threads while one recv the whole picture of tcp stream data and
 immediately showing in the java swing frame and another thread is listening user click button event.
 So, if the server sends frames without interval and
 the client refresh the java frame without interval when receiving video frames,
 ,it can reach a real-time monitor system.

How can i capture a jpg picture from the camera? Because the camera supports two kinds of primitive frame, one is YUV and the other is MJPEG. So i specify MJPEG. But the captured picture is imcomplete format, it must add a huffman table to a special address in the primitive frame.

Finally, about the AVI.I use the camera directly capture jpg picture, so i can
 encode the jpg to a AVI container according to the AVI format which specify the
 video file header format, every jpg file header format and tail format. But, unfortunately,
 i didn't capture voice stream to the video file.

(I think very funny files are `src/monitor_v4l2_uvc.c` and `src/monitor_socket_embeded.c`.
One is the wrapper of v4l2 and another is a linux c wrapper of tcp operation.)
